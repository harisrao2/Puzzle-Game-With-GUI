How to Win: 
You are a prisoner serving a life sentence in jail. In order to win, you must 
first collect the pin located in your Jail Cell. Use this pin to unlock all the
doors throughout the game. Then, you must enter the Bathroom to retrieve the plank 
to take out the first guard that blocks Hall 1. Remember, planks can only be used 
once per guard. Make your way towards the Cafeteria to find a plank laying at the 
very bottom of the map. While you're there, retrieve the plank laying around in the 
Kitchen which is located at the top of the cafeteria. You now have 2 planks. Now, 
leave the Kitchen and the Cafeteria so that you can find yourself in Hall 1 once 
again. Take the pathway that leads towards the bottom of the game map in Hall 1 and 
take out the guard in your way. You should now be in Hall 2. From here, go straight 
up and make the last left. There will be a door when going up. Using the plank you kept
from when you visited the Kitchen, take out one of the guards blocking the exit behind 
them. Congratulations, you have now escaped the prison.
